    <h1>The Story In The Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2> 
     <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist,</em>and all the other scientific journals her work
        had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed
         to be free. </p>
        
         <p>She had spent the last years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
           many consideres her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyribonuclei acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achivement, Molly <em>did</em> think she has something betetr to do. </p>
